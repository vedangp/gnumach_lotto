Version 1.4

Really too many to list them individually.  Highlight include numerous bug and
stability fixes, a Xen port for 32-bit x86 including basic support for Physical
Address Extension (PAE), an initial AHCI driver (SATA hard disks), a new SLAB
memory allocator to replace the previous zone allocator, support for memory
object proxies, access restrictions for x86 I/O ports, support for some PCMCIA
devices based on the pcmcia-cs package.

Version 1.3

The kernel now directly supports "boot scripts" in the form of multiboot
module names with the same syntax as the Hurd's `serverboot' program.
That is, instead of telling GRUB "module /boot/serverboot", you can give
GRUB a series of command like "module /hurd/ext2fs ${...}" where the
syntax after "module" is the same as in boot scripts for Hurd's `serverboot'.

The kernel message device `kmsg' is now enabled by default.
--disable-kmsg turns it off.

Large disks (>= 10GB) are now correctly supported, the new get_status
call DEV_GET_RECORDS can return the number of records of a device.

Lots of tweaks have been done to the virtual memory management to make
it perform better on today's machines.

The console supports ANSI escape sequences for colors and attributes.

Support for the terminal speeds B57600 and B115200 has been added.

Version 1.2

Many bug fixes.

The task_basic_info RPC now has an additional field, holding the
creation time of the task.  Likewise for thread_basic_info.

The interface generator `MiG' has been split out.

Partition names for disks are now printed in the correct way.

Linux drivers are updated to 2.0.36.  Many thanks to Okuji Yoshinori
for great work here.  The Linux emulation support is much improved.

The kernel message device `kmsg' is supported. --enable-kmsg turns on
the device.

The parallel driver is enabled by --enable-lpr.

New make targets, install-kernel and install-headers are added. The
former will install only the kernel, and the latter will install only
the header files.

Print out Mach device names instead of Linux ones.

Version 1.1

Cross-compilation support is much improved.  Any of various popular
libc's is now sufficient for building clib-routines.o.

New configure option --enable-kdb asks for kernel debugger to be
compiled in.

Bug in --enable-ncr53c7xx has been fixed.

Many thanks go to Marcus G. Daniels (marcus@cathcart.sysc.pdx.edu) for
his very helpful testing of the 1.0 release and for his many
improvements to the cross-compilation support.
